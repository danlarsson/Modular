# My Modular
My Modular Eurorack Synth

The plan is to build every module myself, with help from the all mighty internet to get schematics and tips.

KiCad 7.0 is used to create the schematics and PCBs.
PCBWay or JLCPCB is used for the PCBs.

## 1. PSU: Power supply + Breakout board + Frontpanel
  - Power Supply 
    - [X] Design, [X] Order, [] Build, [] Test
